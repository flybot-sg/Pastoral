## Async Control Flow in Pastoral

The  `:async-flow` Effects handler coordinates a set of
asynchronous, stateful tasks which have dependencies (and consequently need to be ordered).

Using this fx handler, you can **coordinate the kind of asynchronous control flow** which
is often necessary to successfully boot
a pastoral game "up" into a functioning state, while also gracefully handling failures.

As an example, imagine a game which, during startup, has to connect with
a backend server via a web socket, load some user settings data, and then a user portfolio, while also
connecting to Intercom, but not until the user settings were loaded, while remembering that
any of these processes might fail because of network problems.

So, it has a similar intent to [mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount)
or [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component),
but it dovetails with, and leverages the event driven nature of pastoral's architecture.

Technically, this library implements an [Effect Handler](https://github.com/flybot-sg/pastoral/tree/develop/doc),
keyed `:async-flow`. It has a declarative, data oriented design.

The handler has been copied from the equivalent [re-frame library](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-async-flow-fx) under the terms of the MIT license.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1. Initiate Boot

In your app's main entry function, we want to initiate the boot process:
```clj
(defn ^:export main
  []
  (dispatch-sync [:boot]))            ;; <--- boot process is started
```

Why the use of `dispatch-sync`, rather than `dispatch`?

Well, `dispatch-sync` is convenient here because it ensures that
`app-db` is synchronously initialised **before** we start mounting components/views (which subscribe to state).  Using
`dispatch` would work too, except it runs the handler **later**.  So, we'd have to then code
defensively in our subscriptions and views, guarding against having an uninitialised `app-db`.

This is the only known case where you should use `dispatch-sync` over `dispatch` (other than in tests).

### Step 2. Registration And Use

In the namespace where you register your event handlers, perhaps called `events.cljc`, you have 3 things to do.

**First**, add this require to the `ns`:
```clj
(ns app.events
  (:require
    ...
    [pastoral.fx.async-flow]   ;; <-- add this
    ...))
```

Because we never subsequently use this `require`, it
appears redundant.  But its existence will cause the `:async-flow` effect
handler to self-register with Pastoral, which is important
to everything that follows.

**Second**, write a function which returns a declarative description (as a data structure) of the async flow required, like this:
```clj
(defn boot-flow
  []
  {:first-dispatch [:do-X]              ;; what event kicks things off ?
   :rules [                             ;; a set of rules describing the required flow
     {:when :seen? :events :success-X  :dispatch [:do-Y]}
     {:when :seen? :events :success-Y  :dispatch [:do-Z]}
     {:when :seen? :events :success-Z  :halt? true}
     {:when :seen-any-of? :events [:fail-X :fail-Y :fail-Z] :dispatch  [:app-failed-state] :halt? true}]})
```
Try to read each `rule` line as an English sentence. When this event happens, dispatch another event.
The rules above combine to run tasks X, Y and Z serially, like dominoes. Much more complicated
scenarios are possible. Full particulars of this data structure are provided below in the Tutorial section.

**Third**, write the event handler for `:boot`:

Remember that `(dispatch-sync [:boot])` in step 2. We are now writing and registering the associated event handler.

This event handler will do two things:
  1. It goes though an initial synchronous series of tasks which get app-db into the right state
  2. It kicks off a multistep asynchronous flow

```clj
(reg-event-fx                    ;; note the -fx
  :boot                          ;; usage:  (dispatch [:boot])  See step 3
  (fn [_ _]
    {:db (-> {}                  ;;  do whatever synchronous work needs to be done
            task1-fn             ;; ?? set state to show "loading" twirly for user??
            task2-fn)            ;; ?? do some other simple initialising of state
     :async-flow  (boot-flow)})) ;; kick off the async process
```

Notice at that last line. This library provides the "effect handler" which implements `:async-flow`. It reads
and actions the data structure returned by `(boot-flow)`.


## Problem Definition

When an App boots, it performs a set of tasks to initialise itself.

Invariably, there are dependencies between these tasks, like task1 has to run before task2.

Because of these dependencies, "something" has to coordinate how tasks are run.  Within the clojure community,
a library like [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) or [mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount)
is often turned to in these moments, but we won't be
doing that here. We'll be using an approach which is more Pastoral friendly.

### Easy

If the tasks are all synchronous, then the coordination can be done in code.

Each task is a function, and we satisfy the task dependencies by correctly
ordering how they are called. In a Pastoral context, we'd have this:
```clj
(reg-event-db
  :boot
  (fn [db]
    (-> {}
        task1-fn
        task2-fn
        task3-fn)))
```

and in our app's `main` function we'd `(dispatch [:boot])`


### Time

But, of course, it is never that easy because some of the tasks will be asynchronous.

A booting app will invariably have to coordinate **asynchronous tasks** like
"open a websocket", "establish a database connections", "load from LocalStore",
"GET configuration from an S3 bucket" and "querying the database for the user profile".

**Coordinating asynchronous tasks means finding ways to represent and manage time**,
and time is a programming menace.
In Greek mythology,  Cronus was the much feared Titan of Time, believed to
bring cruelty and tempestuous disorder, which surely makes him the patron saint of asynchronous programming.

Solutions like promises and futures attempt to make time disappear and allow you to program
with the illusion of synchronous computation. But time has a tendency to act like a liquid under
pressure, finding the cracks and leaking through the abstractions.

Something like [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) (core.async) is
more of an event oriented treatment. Less pretending. But... unfortunately more complicated.
`core.async` builds a little state machine for you, under the covers, so that you can
build your own state machine on
top of that again via deft use of go loops, channels, gets and puts. Both layers try to model/control time.

In our solution, we'll be using a Pastoral variation which hides (most of) the
state machine complexity.


### Failures

There will also be failures and errors!

Nothing messes up tight, elegant code quite like error
handling.  Did the Ancient Greeks have a terrifying Titan for the unhappy
path too? Ernos? They should have.

When one of the asynchronous startup tasks fails, we
must be able to stop the normal boot sequence and put the application
in a satisfactory failed state, sending necessary logs and explaining to the user
what went wrong - eg: "No Internet connection" or "Couldn't load user portfolio".


### Efficiency

And then, of course, there's the familiar pull of efficiency.

We want our app to boot in the shortest possible amount of time. So any asynchronous
tasks which can be done in parallel, must be done in parallel.

The boot process is seldom linear, one task after an another. Instead, it involves
dependencies like:  when task1 has finished, start all of task2, task3 and task4 in
parallel.  And task5 can be started only when both task2 and task3 has completed successfully.
And task6 can start when task3 alone has completed, but we really don't care if it finishes
properly - it is non essential to a working app.

So, we need to coordinate asynchronous flows, with complex dependencies, while handling failures.
Not easy, but that's why they pay us the big bucks.

### As Data Please

Because we program in Clojure, we spend time in hammocks dreamily re-watching Rich Hickey videos and
meditating on essential truths like "data is the ultimate in late binding".

So, our solution must involve "programming with data" and be, at once, all synonyms of easy.

### In One Place

The control flow should be described in just one place, and easily
grokable as a unit.

To put that another way: we do not want a programmer to have to look
in multiple places to reconstruct a mental model of the overall control flow.

## The Solution

**Pastoral has events. That's how we roll.**

A Pastoral application can't step forward in time unless an event happens; unless something
does a `dispatch`.  Events will be the organising principle in our solution exactly
because events are an organising principle within Pastoral itself.

### Tasks and Events

As you'll soon see, our solution assumes the following about tasks...

If we take an X-ray of an async task, we'll see this event skeleton:
 - an event is used to start the task
 - if the task succeeds, an event is dispatched
 - if the task fails, an event is dispatched

So that's three events: **one to start and two ways to finish**. Please read that again
- its importance is sometimes missed on first reading. Your tasks must conform to this
3 event structure (which is not hard).

Of course, Pastoral will route all three events to their registered handler. The actual WORK of
starting the task, or handling the errors, will be done in the event handler that you write.

But, here, none of that menial labour concerns us. **Here we care only about the coordination of
tasks**. We care only that task2 is started when task1 finishes successfully, and we don't need
to know what task1 or task2 actually do.

To distill that: we care only that the `dispatch` to start task2 is fired correctly when we
have seen an event saying that task1 finished successfully.

### When-E1-Then-E2

Read that last paragraph again.  It distills further to: when event E1 happens then
`dispatch` event E2.  Or, more pithily again, When-E1-Then-E2.

When-E1-Then-E2 is the simple case, with more complicated variations like:
  - when **both** events E1 and E2 have happened, then dispatch E3
  - when **either** events E1 or E2 happens, then dispatch E3
  - when event E1 happens, then dispatch both E2 and E3

**We call these "rules". A collection of such rules defines a "flow".**

### Flow As Data

Collectively, a set of When-E1-then-E2 rules can describe the entire async boot flow of an app.

Here's how that might look in data:
```clj
[{:when :seen?        :events :success-db-connect   :dispatch-n '([:do-query-user] [:do-query-site-prefs])}
 {:when :seen-both?   :events [:success-user-query :success-site-prefs-query] :dispatch [:success-boot] :halt? true}
 {:when :seen-any-of? :events [:fail-user-query :fail-site-prefs-query :fail-db-connect] :dispatch [:fail-boot] :halt? true}
 {:when :seen?        :events :success-user-query   :dispatch [:do-intercom]}]
```

That's a vector of 4 maps (one per line), where each represents a single rule. Try reading each
line as if it was an English sentence and something like this should emerge: `when we have seen all of events E1 and E2, then dispatch this other event`

The structure of each rule (map) is:

```clj
{:when       W     ;; one of:  :seen?, :seen-both?, :seen-all-of?, :seen-any-of?
 :events     X     ;; either a single keyword or a seq of keywords representing event ids
 :dispatch   Y     ;; (optional) single vector (to dispatch)
 :dispatch-n Z     ;; (optional) list of vectors (to dispatch)
 :halt?    true}   ;; optional, will teardown the flow after the last event is dispatched
```
Although optional, only one of :dispatch or :dispatch-n can be specified

In our mythical app, we can't issue a database query until we have a database connection, so the 1st rule (above) says:
  1. When `:success-db-connect` is dispatched, presumably signalling that we have a database connection...
  2. then `(dispatch [:query-user])`  and `(dispatch [:query-site-prefs])`

We have successfully booted when both database queries succeed, so the 2nd rule says:
  1. When both success events have been seen (they may arrive in any order),
  2. then `(dispatch [:success-queries])` and cleanup because the boot process is done.

If any task fails, then the boot fails, and the app can't start which means go into a
failure mode, so the 3rd rules says:
  1.  If any one of the various tasks fail...
  2.  then `(dispatch [:fail-boot])` and cleanup because the boot process is done.

Once we have user data (from the user-query), we can start the intercom process, so the 4th rules days:
  1. When `:success-user-query` is dispatched
  2. then  `(dispatch [:do-intercom])`

Further Notes:

1. The 4th rule starts "Intercom" once we have user data. But notice that
   nowhere do we wait for a `:success-intercom`.  We want this process started,
   but it is not essential for the app's function, so we don't wait for it to complete.

2. The coordination processes never actively participate in handling any events. Event handlers
   themselves do all that work. They know how to handle success or failure - what state to record so
   that the twirly thing is shown to users, or not. What messages are shown. Etc.

3. A naming convention for events is adopted. Each task can have 3 associated events which
   are named as follows: `:do-*` is for starting tasks. Task completion is either `:success-*`
   or `:fail-*`

4. The `:halt?` value of true means the boot flow is completed.  Clean up the flow coordinator.
   It will have some state somewhere. So get rid of that.  And it will have been "sniffing events",
   so stop doing that, too. You should provide at least one of these in your rules.

5. There's nothing in here about the teardown process as the application is closing. Here we're only
   helping the boot process.

6. There will need to be something that kicks off the whole flow. In the case above, presumably
   a `(dispatch [:do-connect-db])` is how it all starts.

7. A word on Retries.  XXX

### The Flow Specification

The `:async-flow` data structure has the following fields:

  - `:id` - optional - an identifier, typically a namespaced keyword. Each flow should have a unique id.
    Must not clash with the identifier for any event handler (because internally
    an event handler is registered using this id).
    If absent, `:async/flow` is used.
    If this default is used then two flows can't be running at once because they'd be using the same id.

  - `db-path` - optional - the path within `app-db` where the coordination logic should store state. Two pieces
     of state are stored:  the set of seen events, and the set of started tasks.
    If absent, then state is not stored in app-db and is instead held in an internal atom.
    We prefer to store state in app-db because we like the philosophy of having all the data in the one place,
    but it is not essential.
  - `first-dispatch` - mandatory - the event which initiates the async flow. This is often
    something like the event which will open a websocket or HTTP GET configuration from the server.
  - `rules` - mandatory - a vector of maps. Each map is a `rule`.

A `rule` is a map with the following fields:

  - `:when`  one of `:seen?`, `:seen-both?`. `:seen-all-of?`, `:seen-any-of?`
    `:seen?`, `:seen-both?` and `:seen-all-of?` are interchangeable.
  - `:events` either a single keyword, or a collection of keywords, presumably event ids.
              a collection can also contain whole event vectors that will be matched,
              or event predicates that return true or false when passed an event vector.
  - `:dispatch` can be a single vector representing one event to dispatch.
  - `:dispatch-n` to dispatch multiple events, must be a coll where each elem represents one event to dispatch.
  - `:halt?` optional boolean. If true, the flow enters teardown and stops.


### Under The Covers

How does async-flow work? It does the following:

  1. It dynamically creates an event handler to perform the flow coordination.
  2. It registers this event handler using the supplied `:id`
  3. It requests that all `:events` mentioned in `flow` rules should be "forwarded" to
     this event handler, after they have been handled by their normal handlers.
     So, if the event `:abc` was part of `flow` spec, then after `[:abc 1]` was handled by its normal handler
     there would be an additional `(dispatch [:async/flow  [:abc 1]])` which would be handled the coordinator
     created in steps 1 and 2.
  4. the event handler keeps track of what events have occurred, and what tasks have already
     been started. It keeps this state at the path nominated in `:db-path`.
  5. the event handler uses your `flow` specification and the state it internally
     maintains to work out how it should
     respond to each newly forwarded event.
  6. At some point, the flow finishes (failed or succeeded) and the event handler from step 1
     is dispatched a `:halt-flow`. It de-registers itself, and stops all event sniffing.


Notes:
  1.  This pattern is flexible. You could use it to implement a more complex FSM coordinator.
  2.  All the work is done in a normal event handler (dynamically created for you).  And
      it is all organised around events which this event handler processes. So this
      solution is aligned on Pastoral fundamentals.


## Design Philosophy

Managing async task flow means managing time, and managing time requires a state machine. You need:
   - some retained state   (describing where we have got to)
   - events which announce that something has happened or not happened (aka FSM triggers)
   - a set of rules about transitioning app state and triggering further activity when events arrive.

One way or another you'll be implementing a state machine. There's no getting away from that.

Although there are ways of hiding it!! Redux-saga uses ES6 generator functions to provide the illusion of a
synchronous control flow. The "state machine" is encoded directly into the generator function's
statements (sequentially, or via `if` `then` `else` logic, or via `loops`). And that's a nice
and simple abstraction for many cases.

But, as always, there are trade-offs.

First, the state machine is encoded in javascript "code" (the generator function implements
the state machine). In clojure, we have a preference for "programming in data" where possible.

Second, coding (in javascript) a more complicated state machine with a bunch of failure states and
cascades will ultimately get messy. Time is like a liquid under pressure and it will force its way
out through the cracks in the abstraction.  A long history with FSM encourages us to implement
state machines in a data driven way (a table driven way).

So we choose data and reject the redux-saga approach (while being mindful of the takeoffs).

A motivated user might also produce a fully general FSM version of this effects handler.
