> Come live with me and be my Love,

> And we will all the pleasures prove

> That hills and valleys, dale and field,

> And all the craggy mountains yield."

> There will we sit upon the rocks

> And see the shepherds feed their flocks,

> By shallow rivers, to whose falls

> Melodious birds sing madrigals.

> -- Christopher Marlowe, The Passionate Shepherd to His Love
