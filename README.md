## Derived Values, Flowing, For Arcadia

Pastoral is a pattern for writing games in Clojure that is a port of some parts
of [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) to
[ClojureCLR](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr) and
[Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia).

More specifically, Pastoral includes
[re-frame's](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) event handling, dispatch,
interceptors, coeffects and effects. However it replaces the subscription and
view layers with approaches more suitable for games running on
[Unity](http://unity.com).
